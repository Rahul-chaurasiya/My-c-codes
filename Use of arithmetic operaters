int main()

      int  a=5,b=6;

   printf("the value of a+b is :%d\n",a+b);
   printf("the value of a-b is :%d\n",a-b);
   printf("the value of a/b is :%d\n",a/b);
   printf("the value of a*b is :%d\n",a*b);

    return 0;

}

Output :

the value of a+b is :11

the value of a-b is :-1

the value of a/b is :0

the value of a*b is :30
